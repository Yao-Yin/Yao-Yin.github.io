Just as I wrote in [*About Me*]({% post_url 2021-05-14-about-me %}), I love the world of CS and math and I taught myself bits of knowledge in these fields and use them to pass the entrance exam of UTokyo and to be hired as a software engineer. This post is about what I did and what I will do in the future.  

I got my bachelor's degree in pharmacy but I decided to quit that in the 4th year of my undergraduate studies. Thus I have no extra time to persue anthor bacholer's degree in computer science/math/software engineering. With generous seggestions from one of my good friends who is a Google software engineer now, I decided to learn open source computer science courses.

___

## 2018.3.1 ~ 2019.3.31

The entrance examination of computational biology department in UTokyo needs calculus, linear algebra, graph theory, data structures, algorithms, probability, statistics and stochastic processes. In order to pass the examination, I spent most of time on math courses.

  - Currently solved all problems before [chapter 3.3](https://vjudge.net/article/46). (2021.5.15)
- Solve another 1000 problems on various online judges
  - I wish to have a rating over 2000 on [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/), currently around 1400. (2021.5.15)
    - Because I usually play sports at Saturday night, I didn't attend much competitions this year, but I never stop practicing. (2021.12.17)
- I wish to win a T-shirt from GCJ or FHC or TCO. (Made it, yay~)
  - For GCJ, I need to be qualified for GCJ R3, currently qualified for GCJ R2 (2021.5.15). But I didn't make it this year :(. (2021.12.17)
  - For FHC, I need to be qualified for FHC R2 and solve at lease 1 problem and be ranked in top 2000. I made it, actually 1,278th out of 6,789 :). (2021.12.17)
  - For TCO, I missed the event. It was at the beginning of this year, so it's ok. (2021.12.17)


### Operating System

- [MIT 6.S081](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.S081/2020/)
  - [Github](https://github.com/yao-yin/xv6-labs-2020)

- I decided to change course from MIT 6.S081 to [Tsinghua OS course](https://github.com/rcore-os/rCore). Because I wanna learn Rust. Rust sounds fancier than C. (2021.12.17)

### Computer Networking

- [Stanford CS144](https://cs144.github.io/)
  - Start from 2021.5.12
  - [Github](https://github.com/yao-yin/sponge), might be set to be private in the future if requested by course owners

### Database

- [CMU 15-445](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2019/)
  - ~~Will start it if I finish two above courses~~ I will study computer architecture before this on. (2021.12.17)
  
  
### Computer Architecture

- [ETHZ Digital Design and Computer Architecture](https://safari.ethz.ch/digitaltechnik/spring2020/doku.php?id=labs)
  - Wait my FPGA board to arrive (2021.5.15)

### Compiler

- [CS143](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs143/)
  
### Design Patterns

- Haven't decided where to study it (2021.5.15).
- Learned it from working with excellent colleagues. (2021.12.17)

I am also interested in other criteria such as distributed systems, but most of them need above courses as prerequite. I'll think about it after I finish the above courses.  

___

By the way, I believe all of the courses above can cover requirements of a bachelor's degree in computer science engineering, so I call it "yy的补全计划" (YY's completion plan). If you see this word in some other place, that should be me.  

At the very beginning of this plan, I wished to finish it before 2022.9, after changing some contents of it and becoming a fulltime software engineer, I found that most of energy will be taken to do my job and I would like to spend much more time with my dear girlfriend. Thus pushing myself crucially is meaningless. I wanna enjoy my job, enjoy my life, enjoy these courses, and don't want to be burnt out. ~~My estimation on the date that I finish these courses is 2023.3, a traditional graduation season in Japan.~~ Actually it's lifetime study, just enjoy it~

頑張ります!
