Hi, I am Yao Yin, a software engineer based in Tokyo.  

I got my bachelor's degree in pharmacy from Nankai University, and a master's degree in computational biology from The University of Tokyo (Todai). At graduate school, I spent 2 wonderful years on research in algorithms for biological sequences alignment with [Prof. Frith](https://sites.google.com/site/frithbioinfo/home?authuser=0). If you are interested in our research, please check our [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.25.428050v1) on AICoB 2020 & 2021.  

I love the world of math, statistics, and computer science. I taught myself bits of knowledge on them to pass the graduate school entrance examination and get hired by my current company. You can find my self-learning journey [here]({% post_url 2021-05-15-my-journey-in-cs-and-math %}).  

Before COVID-19 situation, I love playing table tennis. Currently I spend my spare time relaxing, reading, learning, and chatting with my girlfriend. I miss her so much.
